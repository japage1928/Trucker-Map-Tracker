ROLE
You are acting as a senior software architect refactoring code inside an existing app without degrading its architecture.

CONTEXT
This project already contains a working app (“Trucker Buddy”).
The uploaded codebase (“Haulos”) represents a prior, cleaner implementation of driving-related logic.

PRIMARY GOAL
Create a self-contained Driving Engine module inside this app, derived from Haulos, that can be consumed by the existing Trucker Buddy app without sharing state or logic in both directions.

MANDATORY CONSTRAINTS (DO NOT VIOLATE)
	•	Create a dedicated folder such as /driving-engine or /core/driving
	•	Treat this folder as a black box
	•	NO React components, hooks, UI, routing, or app state inside the engine
	•	Engine code must be pure logic only (functions, types, helpers)
	•	All dependencies (location, POIs, heading, speed) must be injected as inputs
	•	The existing app must adapt to the engine API, not the engine adapting to the app
	•	Do NOT move engine logic into existing components
	•	Do NOT introduce globals, side effects, or timers inside the engine

ENGINE CONTRACT
Define a clear public API that accepts:
	•	current location
	•	heading
	•	speed
	•	list of POIs

And returns:
	•	POIs ahead
	•	distances / ordering
	•	any derived driving decisions (no UI state)

PROCESS REQUIREMENTS
	1.	Analyze Haulos and identify logic that belongs in the engine
	2.	Refactor that logic into the isolated engine folder
	3.	Leave UI, hooks, and app-specific wiring outside the engine
	4.	Replace any existing disabled or broken driving logic by calling the engine API
	5.	If something cannot be cleanly isolated, STOP and explain why instead of forcing integration

SUCCESS CRITERIA
	•	The app builds and runs
	•	Driving logic lives in exactly one place
	•	The engine can theoretically be extracted later with minimal changes
	•	No duplication of logic between engine and app

IMPORTANT
Do not optimize for speed or convenience.
Optimize for correctness, isolation, and long-term maintainability.
