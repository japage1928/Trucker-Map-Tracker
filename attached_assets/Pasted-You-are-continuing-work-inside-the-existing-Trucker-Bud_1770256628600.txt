You are continuing work inside the existing “Trucker Buddy” web app.
You are NOT creating a navigation app.
You are NOT providing turn-by-turn directions.

You are merging functionality from a previous project into this one.
DO NOT create a new project or change frameworks.
DO NOT refactor unrelated code.
DO NOT replace existing map or POI logic unless necessary.

CORE CONCEPT:
Truck tracking, not navigation.
The app passively follows the user’s current GPS location and surfaces relevant stop information ahead of them.

GOAL:
Extend the app so it continuously tracks the driver’s location and highlights upcoming stops along their current direction of travel.

TRACKING REQUIREMENTS:
1. Use the device’s GPS to:
   - Continuously update the user’s current position.
   - Track heading/bearing and speed (if available).
2. The map should:
   - Stay centered slightly ahead of the truck, not directly on top of it.
   - Update smoothly without animations or route drawing.

STOPS AHEAD LOGIC:
1. Determine “ahead” based on:
   - Current heading/bearing.
   - A configurable forward distance (e.g. 5, 10, 25 miles).
2. From saved + seeded POIs:
   - Identify stops that fall within a forward-facing cone or corridor.
   - Exclude POIs behind the truck.
3. Display:
   - Distance to stop.
   - Category (Fuel, Parking, Rest Area, Scale, Food, etc.).
   - Notes (if available).

UI REQUIREMENTS:
- Add a simple “Stops Ahead” panel:
  - Auto-updates as the truck moves.
  - Sorted by distance.
  - Tap a stop to center the map on it.
- No routes.
- No directions.
- No spoken instructions.
- Minimal text, large touch targets, dark mode compatible.

DATA & PERFORMANCE:
- Reuse existing POI storage and data models.
- Do not constantly reprocess all POIs every GPS tick.
- Throttle updates (reasonable interval for driving).
- Must work with spotty signal.

MERGE RULES:
- Integrate previous project logic cleanly into the current structure.
- If code is reused, clearly comment where it came from and why.
- If a helper module is needed (e.g. tracking or filtering), keep it small and isolated.

OUTPUT:
- Modify only necessary files.
- Provide new helper files only if justified.
- Brief explanation of:
  - How “ahead” is calculated.
  - How often location updates occur.
  - How performance is protected.
